# Kodi Repository for my TIDAL2 Addon

This branch is for Kodi versions 17 (Krypton) and 18 (Leia).

This Kodi repository contains my [TIDAL2 Addon](https://github.com/arnesongit/plugin.audio.tidal2) which is a modified version
of the official [TIDAL Addon from tamland](https://github.com/tamland/kodi-tidal).

It contains also my [Context Item Addon](https://github.com/arnesongit/context.item.tidal2) to search TIDAL content from every selected item.

The third addon in this repository is a script addon to change the system volume on Linux or MacOS.
It can be used to change the volume of a different volume control of the operating system while
the Kodi volume stays unchanged. This can be useful for hardware MQA decoders which assume that
the Kodi volume stays at 100% all the time.
